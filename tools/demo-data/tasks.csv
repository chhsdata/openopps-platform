We know most organizations across government have invested in innovations, but often times those innovations go undiscovered by those who need them most.

Help us by being an Innovation Ambassador for your agency. We need you to find and share data around innovation your organization has funded, and then connect and empower those innovators and companies by giving them access to highlight themselves on the Exchange. This could be as simple as sharing an excel data sheet on your recent challenge applicants and winners or by sending an email to them to let them know about the Exchange.
