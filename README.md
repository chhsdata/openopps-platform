# Open Opportunities for California

You've reached the CHHS fork of [Open Opportunities](https://github.com/openopps/openopps-platform/), originally developed by the U.S. Federal Government. We are currently evaluating Open Opportunities for fit within California's Health and Human Services Agency. To learn more about the project and its purpose, the original Federal text continues below.

## The Open Opps Story (Federal)

[Open Opportunities](http://www.digitalgov.gov/join-digitalgov/open-opportunities-in-digitalgov/) is creating a network of federal employees that will lead to a more effective, efficient, responsive government by sharing skills and collaborating on projects that support the mission of an agency or the government as a whole.

OpenOpps is the open source platform that supports the Open Opportunities program.  As open source software, it can be deployed by state or local governments or in the private sector.  It is free to use by anyone who can has technical operations staff and passion to start a new program, and we welcome everyone who would like to contribute to improving the platform.

Here’s how Open Opportunities works: You come up with a great idea that would help your workplace, but you and your coworkers don’t have the skills to execute it. Rather than bringing in a contractor, you can post your project idea to Open Opportunities, where other people within your organization can see it and then work on it, if they’d like.

Open Opportunities can benefit all organizations, but it’s especially useful for those with distributed teams and whose employees have diverse skill sets.  Using Open Opportunities, you and your colleagues can work on projects together, get to know each other better, and develop skills you don’t use as often as you’d like.

## More Project Details (Federal)

Problem Statement: Our workforce often lacks talent and skills where and when they are needed.

- working across organizational boundaries is difficult
- professional development opportunities are scarce
- only 35% of federal employees believe creativity and innovation are rewarded (2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey)

Solution: provide a software platform that enables a program with very small central staff and program leaders across government that provide professional development opportunities

Our Goal: to foster innovation across team boundaries by connecting individuals who identify challenges and then work collaboratively to implement solutions.
